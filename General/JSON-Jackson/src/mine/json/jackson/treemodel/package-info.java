/**
 * Parsing JSON - Tree Traversing(DOM Based)
 * 
 * The complete JSON is read into a JsonNode (in-memory). The node then be traversed to get the required property.
 * 
 * The tree (JsonNode) can also be created and then written as JSON string.
 * 
 * Jackson provides a tree node called com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode.
 * The ObjectMapper provides a method to read the JSON into a tree with the root being a JsonNode.
 * This can be thought of as being similar to DOM nodes in XML DOM trees.
