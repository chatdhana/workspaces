<p>About Us</p>
<p>JobsCorp Ltd. is a Placement Consultants that operates in an international basis.</p>

<p>We provide job seekers with free and instant access to millions of jobs from 
thousands of companies via one simple search.
 Our proprietary search technology crawls the internet to find job listings from 
 corporate web sites, job boards, recruitment agencies, newspapers, classifieds 
 and numerous other sources.</p>

<p>We strive to make job search a fun and easy experience. Nowadays there are more and more new sources for jobs on the 
internet and the process of finding them is becoming more time consuming and 
complicated. Job seekers have to visit multiple web sites, and manage multiple accounts and registrations.
 We believe that people just want one place where they can quickly and simply search and track all the jobs that match their interests.</p>

<p>We provide job searchers with powerful tools so that they can search jobs using a combination of keywords, locations and even by company name. Job searches can also be saved as alerts and sent to job seekers daily via sms.</p>

<p>We also help job sites and companies increase visibility and exposure for their
 job listings by driving traffic directly to the jobs on their web site. 
 We only display a summary of the job details on JobsCorp.com and then direct users to the web site to apply for the job. 
 If you would like us to add your web site and job content please click here to submit the details for consideration. (We do not charge any fee but in order to maintain data integrity and quality for our users we only include jobs from reputable sources which meet a consistent high level of quality).</p>

<p>As a business, JobsCorp generates revenue through adnetTM our Pay-Per-Click keyword advertising system which provides advertisers with the ability to deliver measurable, cost-effective online advertising that is highly targeted and relevant to the information displayed on our search results pages.</p>
